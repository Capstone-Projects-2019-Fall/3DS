# 3DS
The 3DS (Distracted Driver Detection System) is a system that reminds drivers to avoid distractions while operation a vehicle.

## Features Implemented
* Facial and Eye Detection: The 3DS will detect when a face is in view of the camera. When the eyes look away from the road and can no longer be detected the 3DS will remind the driver to pay attention
* Phone Recognition: When a smartphone is in view of the camera the 3DS will detect it and remind the driver to pay attention
* Speed Detection: The 3DS contains an accelerometer and will only sound the alarm when the car is moving

## Bugs
There are currently no known bugs

## Installation
The 3DS is designed to run on a RASPberry pi with and accelerometer and camera connected. If you would like to run it from a PC make sure you are on a Linux OS and have a webcam. A log file with speed data has been provided to take the place of the accelerometer.
